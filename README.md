## MBA Extention Pearson College of London - Health Project

Graduation project for the extention of MBA Applied Data Science for Business on Pearson College of London 

-----------

## Description:
The main goal of the project is to analyse the % of healthcare expenses by GDP of 34 european countries and try to relate with their life expectancy.

-----------

## How it was done

- extraction of datasets (healthcare-spending, population, economy and life expactancy) from the macrotrend website: https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/GBR/united-kingdom/healthcare-spending
- CSVs with different variables by country were merged, treated and labeled using python and R Scripts
- All exploratory and discriptive analysis was made in Tableau (can be found in the main branch of this repository) 
- The mixed modelling was made in R and the final results can be found in the main branch of this repository

-----------

## Results

- We could see that for most of the countries had a positive relation between % of healthcare expenses by GDP and life expectancy.
- For a few countries this positive relation could not be seen which can be next steps to be done in a future 

-----------

## Next steps

- Make a deeper study in the countries which not presented the positive relation between % of healthcare expenses by GDP and life expectancy to understand the reasons
- Make a deeper study in the countries which  presented positive relation between % of healthcare expenses by GDP and life expectancy to understand the reasons and see if they can be implemented in other countries
